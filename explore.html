        <h2 class="food-head">Food</h2>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Food has an important role in the culture and cuisine of every country
          in the world. Different types of food combine to create tasty culinary
          delights that can bring people together. Food culture often develops
          by combining local ingredients, different cooking styles, and
          influences from cuisines from around the world.
        </p>
        <img src="cover.jpeg" alt="food" class="food-imgex" />
        <p class="food-ex">
          This means that most people can eat variety of foods from the many
          types of cuisines. But what are the building blocks of these dishes?
          In this article, you will learn about the many different types of
          foods and about the 7 food categories. You will also find out how many
          of these basic food staples can be transformed into delicious dishes.
        </p>
        <h2 class="food-head">Type of Food</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Vegetables:</h3>
        <img src="vegetables.jpg" alt="vegetables" class="food-imgex" />
        <p class="food-ex">
          Vegetables are some of the most important foods we need to consume
          regularly. Depending on which part of the plant is consumed, the food
          in the vegetables category is divided into a number of subcategories.
          There are root vegetables, bulb vegetables, stem, leafy, and podded
          vegetables.
        </p>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Some ‘vegetables’ such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and eggplant are
          actually types of fruit botanically, but in the culinary world are
          eaten as vegetables.
        </p>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Root vegetables are some of the most commonly consumed plants. In many
          cultures, potatoes are an important source of carbohydrates. Potatoes
          can be boiled, fried, sauteed, or mashed. In Northern Europe and
          America ‘French fries’ are one of the most popular foods. Also, most
          restaurants serve potatoes as a side dish. Bulbous vegetables are also
          important foods in nearly every type of cuisine. Chopped garlic or
          onions are often fried gently and form the basis of many French,
          Chinese, Indian, and Mediterranean dishes.
        </p>

        <p class="food-ex">
          Other important vegetables included in this category are green leafy
          vegetables. Healthy foods such as fresh lettuce, spinach, and other
          greens can be mixed with tomatoes, cucumbers, olive oil, and lemon
          juice to create a Mediterranean salad. In Asian cuisine, bok choy,
          Chinese lettuce, broccoli, or kale are often stir-fried with other
          vegetables and meat.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Non-Veg:</h3>
        <img src="meat.jpg" alt="chicken" class="food-imgex" />
        <p class="food-ex">
          There are very few cultures where meat and poultry are not important
          types of food. Some animals such as cows, pigs, chickens, and lamb are
          raised specifically for their meat. Others, such as game birds, wild
          boar, rabbits, and deer, are often hunted. For cooking, meat can be
          minced, cut into chops, diced, sliced, or roasted as large cuts.
        </p>

        <p class="food-ex">
          In many Western countries, one of the best kind of food to eat is a
          rare to medium cooked steak. Even though Westerners tend to eat too
          much red meat such as beef and pork, hamburgers, meatballs and
          sausages are popular meal choices. Deep-fried chicken drumsticks or
          wings are also a popular Sunday lunch in Southern states in the US. Of
          course, turkeys or chickens roasted whole in the oven are a
          traditional holiday food in many countries.
        </p>

        <p class="food-ex">
          Many food cultures also include cured meats in their culinary
          delicacies. For example, Spain has dry-cured Jamon or Serrano ham,
          Italy has Parma ham, and in American cuisine, bacon is a popular
          breakfast staple.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Cookie:</h3>
        <img src="cookie.jpeg" alt="cookie" class="food-imgex" />
        <p class="food-ex">
          In the wide world of desserts, cookies are perhaps the friendliest and
          most versatile treat. They can be as simple as shortbread, an
          elemental combination of flour, sugar, and butter, or as
          time-intensive and beautiful as these Brown-Butter-Cardamom
          Spitzbuben, each one featuring a jewel-like cutout of jam. They can be
          studded with chocolate chips or used to sandwich lemon curd, dulce de
          leche, or minty white chocolate. You can roll them out and cut them
          out or just dollop them onto a sheet pan. Perhaps your childhood
          included a cookie of particular significance to you. Maybe, as was the
          case for former Food & Wine features editor Nina Friend, your family
          cookie recipe is so good it spurred the creation of a small business.
        </p>
        <p class="food-ex">
          No matter which cookies you favor, now's the time to get baking.
          Cookies are portable and easy to share, while being and endlessly
          adaptable to suit various tastes and dietary restrictions. You can
          wrap them up and put them in the mail, and (carefully) deliver them to
          friends and neighbors less messily than a pie or cake. If your
          household is small, you can freeze them to ensure holiday baked-goods
          abundance will stretch into the new year.
        </p>

        <p class="food-ex">
          We've collected a treasure trove of cookie knowledge, whether it's
          finding the perfect chocolate chip cookie for your textural needs,
          figuring out how to roll out dough without getting flour everywhere,
          hunting down the most aesthetically pleasing cookies, or finding out
          which cookies to mail order to the folks you won't see holiday season
          but want to feed. Go forth and cookie.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Bread:</h3>
        <img src="bread.jpeg" alt="bread" class="food-imgex" />
        <p class="food-ex">
          Bread, baked food product made of flour or meal that is moistened,
          kneaded, and sometimes fermented. A major food since prehistoric
          times, it has been made in various forms using a variety of
          ingredients and methods throughout the world. The first bread was made
          in Neolithic times, nearly 12,000 years ago, probably of coarsely
          crushed grain mixed with water, with the resulting dough probably laid
          on heated stones and baked by covering with hot ashes. The Egyptians
          apparently discovered that allowing wheat doughs to ferment, thus
          forming gases, produced a light, expanded loaf, and they also
          developed baking oven
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Cake:</h3>
        <img src="cake.jpeg" alt="cake" class="food-imgex" />
        <p class="food-ex">
          he term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking
          origin, from the Old Norse word "kaka".
        </p>

        <p class="food-ex">
          The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (plakous), which was derived
          from the word for "flat", πλακόεις (plakoeis). It was baked using
          flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. They also had a cake
          called "satura", which was a flat, heavy cake. During the Roman
          period, the name for cake became "placenta", which was derived from
          the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a
          pastry case.
        </p>

        <p class="food-ex">
          The Greeks invented beer as a leavener, frying fritters in olive oil,
          and cheesecakes using goat's milk. In ancient Rome, the basic bread
          dough was sometimes enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, which
          produced a sweet and cake-like baked good. The Latin poet Ovid refers
          to his and his brother's birthday party and cake in his first book of
          exile, Tristia.
        </p>

        <p class="food-ex">
          Early cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious
          differences between a "cake" and "bread" were the round, flat shape of
          the cakes and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while
          cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.
        </p>

        <p class="food-ex">
          Sponge cakes, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during the
          Renaissance, possibly in Spain.
        </p>
        <h2 class="food-head">Food and Mood</h2>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Certainly! The connection between food and mood is a fascinating area
          of study. While the research is still inconclusive, there are
          intriguing hints that our dietary choices may impact our mental
          well-being. Let’s explore this further:
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Nutrients and Brain Chemistry:</h3>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Important nutrients can affect brain chemistry, influencing mood,
          memory, and cognitive function. Consuming a healthy balance of whole
          foods that provide a variety of nutrients is associated with feeling
          calmer, more content, and generally in a better mood
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Positive Effects of a Varied, Healthy Diet:</h3>
        <p class="food-ex">
          A varied, healthy diet has several benefits: Improved memory and
          concentration Increased optimism Protection against depression Whole
          foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids, play a
          crucial role in promoting mental health
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Caution with Processed and Sugary Foods:</h3>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Highly processed, fried foods and sugary food and drinks have been
          linked to: Increased anxiety Higher risk of developing depression
          Moderation and mindful choices are essential to maintain a positive
          mood
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Complex Interplay of Factors:</h3>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Depression, like many chronic conditions, results from a complex
          interaction between genetics and environment. While we can study
          modifiable risk factors associated with depression, it’s challenging
          to estimate the exact percentage of depression linked to specific
          dietary factors, as they are interconnected
        </p>
        <h2 class="food-head">Food and Emotions</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Stress Eating:</h3>
        <p class="food-ex">
          We’ve all been there—sitting in front of the TV after a tough day,
          mindlessly scooping ice cream from the container. Stress eating is a
          real phenomenon, where our emotions drive us to seek comfort in food.
          However, the relationship between food and mood disorders, such as
          depression, remains less clear
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Research Hints:</h3>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Large observational studies have hinted at links between diet and
          depression. For instance: A 2005 study found associations between
          obesity, depression, and dietary factors. A 2011 study revealed that
          women who consumed more vitamin D–rich foods had a lower risk of
          depression. A 2014 study associated depression with a diet high in
          sugar-sweetened soft drinks, refined grains, and red meat. A 2018
          meta-analysis suggested that excessive meat consumption might be
          linked to depression risk
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Dopamine Release:</h3>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Eating releases dopamine—a brain chemical that makes us feel good.
          When we’re emotionally low, seeking comfort in food can provide a
          temporary boost. It becomes a way to cope with difficult emotions,
          filling an emotional void.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Complex Interaction:</h3>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Depression, like many chronic conditions, results from a complex
          interplay of genetics and environment. While modifiable lifestyle
          factors (such as diet) may influence depression risk, it’s challenging
          to pinpoint a specific food or dietary pattern that directly affects
          it. Factors like smoking, physical activity, and overall lifestyle
          play interconnected roles.
        </p>
        <h2 class="food-head">Food Habits</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-food">Good food habit:</h3>
        <p class="food-ex">
          Almost all of us love to go out and eat a delicious dish at a
          restaurant. There are also some days when we order our favorite food
          at home, and at times we also overeat it! It’s okay if it happens once
          or twice a month, but you might want to do something if it’s more than
